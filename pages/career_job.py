- The best time to search for the job is when you already have it. Or if you are in college, then last semester is the best time to look out for the jobs.
- Other time is when you see signs of upcoming layoffs.
- Because once you are out of college or you have been laid off or have lost the job due to unforeseen circumstances, then it's tough by design to get the job. You'll be fighting against a timeline, you'll have hard time getting decent hike and so on.
