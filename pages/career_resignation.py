"""
- Once you have the final offer letter, you can choose either to resign in the current organization or to ask your manager about retention.
- Retention can help you stay in the same company with some higher package.
- Be clear with your choice before talking to manager or HR about this.
"""

st.header("During Notice Period")
"""
- Once you have resigned, make sure you serve the complete notice period.
- It helps you relax as workload will be lesser. Also, you'll be getting paid for un-applied privilege leaves in your full-and-final settlement.
- But of course, choice of serving complete notice period depends on the individual.
- Complete all the pending works and knowledge transfer on time.
- Try not to spoil your relationship with people you have worked with.
- Download all the pay slips and relevant documents before the last working day.
- Leave gracefully.
- Also, you can interview for more opportunities parallelly, given you already have one offer.
- Now you can be demanding and see where things might go.
