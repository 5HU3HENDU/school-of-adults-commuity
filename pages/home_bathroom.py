"""
- If space is tight, use a towel ladder or towel rail instead of hooks
- Keep one big bin with a lid.
- To keep mold away and to reduce mineral buildup, spray white vinegar or sprinkle baking soda with salt in corners of the bathroom.
- Keep a diffuser with lemon + eucalyptus oil to kill foul smell.
- Stick or place naphthalene balls or camphor in corners to repel bugs.
- Bathroom must always be equipped with floor wiper, bucket, mug, disinfectant, drain uncloggger and a liquid handwash.
- Items for personal hygiene(Shampoo, soap, bodywash, facewash, razor) can always be kept separately in a wash bag to organize stuff effectively.
