- From your salary bank account or other bank accounts, transfer 10k-20k to the online-only bank account as and when needed.
- Use credit card for transactions whenever possible to keep your bank accounts secure.
- This way, you are using online-only bank accounts + credit cards for your spends, while keeping your main bank accounts as secure as possible.
- This also helps you in budgeting to some extent.
